A graph-based AI system for predicting drug-disease interactions with applications in drug repurposing and R&D prioritization.

## üìã Project Overview

This project builds a comprehensive knowledge graph from biomedical data sources and applies graph neural networks to predict potential therapeutic relationships between drugs and diseases. By leveraging established biomedical databases and state-of-the-art graph deep learning techniques, we aim to identify novel drug repurposing opportunities and assist in R&D prioritization.

The system integrates data from:
- DrugBank for comprehensive drug information
- Disease ontologies (MeSH) for disease classification
- OpenTargets Platform for evidence-based target-disease associations

## üìä Data Preparation

The project uses several biomedical databases that require registration and download.

### DrugBank Data

To download DrugBank data, you need to register for a free account at [DrugBank.ca](https://go.drugbank.com/).

```bash
# Parse DrugBank XML
python src/scripts/parse_drugbank.py --input data/raw/full_database/full_database.xml --output data/processed/drugs

# Process vocabulary
python src/scripts/parse_vocabulary.py --input data/raw/open_data/drugbank_all_drugbank_vocabulary.csv
```

### Disease Data from MeSH

```bash
# Download and process MeSH data
python src/scripts/download_mesh.py --output data/raw/mesh
python src/scripts/process_mesh.py --input data/raw/mesh --output data/processed/diseases/mesh
```

### OpenTargets Platform Data

```bash
# Download and process OpenTargets data
python src/scripts/download_opentargets.py --output data/raw/open_targets
python src/scripts/process_opentargets.py --input data/raw/open_targets --output data/processed/associations/opentargets
```

## üèóÔ∏è Building the Knowledge Graph

```bash
# Build the unified knowledge graph
python src/scripts/build_graph.py \
  --drugbank data/processed/drugs/drugbank_parsed.pickle \
  --disease data/processed/diseases/mesh/disease_taxonomy.pickle \
  --associations data/processed/associations/opentargets/drug_disease_indications.pickle \
  --output data/graph/full
```

## üß† Training Models

```bash
# Train GNN model
python src/scripts/train_model.py --graph data/graph/full/knowledge_graph.pyg
```

## üåê API Usage

```bash
# Start API service
uvicorn src.ddi.api.main:app --reload
```

## üìä Example Notebook

We provide example notebooks demonstrating data exploration and model usage:

```bash
# Run Jupyter notebook
jupyter notebook notebooks/01_data_exploration.ipynb
```

## üî¨ Research Applications

This system can be applied to:

1. **Drug Repurposing**
   - Identify existing drugs for new disease indications
   - Prioritize candidates based on confidence scores

2. **R&D Prioritization**
   - Evaluate promising targets for specific diseases
   - Identify potential mechanisms of action

3. **Side Effect Prediction**
   - Identify potential adverse effects early in development
   - Understand the mechanism of observed side effects

## üöÄ Future Work

- Integration of patient genomic data
- Temporal analysis of clinical trial outcomes
- Multimodal data integration with imaging and clinical notes
- Federated learning across institutional data silos
