# Drug-Disease Interaction Prediction: Updated Implementation Plan

## Phase 1: Data Processing & Integration (Weeks 1-4)

### Week 1: DrugBank Data Processing
1. Process the DrugBank XML data that you've already successfully parsed
2. Parse the DrugBank vocabulary CSV to ensure consistent identifiers
3. Integrate vocabulary data with XML data for comprehensive drug information
4. Extract molecular properties and chemical descriptors from structure files
5. Process protein and gene sequences from FASTA files

### Week 2: Disease Taxonomy Processing from MeSH
1. Implement the MeSH parser to extract disease information from the XML files
2. Process the latest MeSH descriptor (desc2025.xml) and qualifier (qual2025.xml) files
3. Extract disease taxonomy and hierarchical relationships
4. Create a unified disease dataset with identifiers, descriptions, and hierarchical information
5. Develop entity resolution mechanisms to map between different disease identifier systems

### Week 3: Drug-Target-Disease Associations from OpenTargets
1. Implement the OpenTargets parser to process the parquet files
2. Extract drug-target associations with supporting evidence

### Week 4: Knowledge Graph Construction
1. Design a comprehensive graph schema that accommodates all data sources
2. Develop entity resolution to map between different identifier systems
3. Build a unified knowledge graph with:
   - Drug nodes (from DrugBank)

   - Multiple relationship types with evidence scores
4. Validate graph completeness and integrity
5. Export graph in multiple formats (NetworkX, DGL, PyG) for analysis and modeling

## Phase 2: Feature Engineering & Data Analysis (Weeks 5-6)

### Week 5: Graph Analysis
1. Analyze graph structure and connectivity patterns
